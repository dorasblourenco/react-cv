Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, Code Igniter 3, etc. With these technologies I was able to develop responsive websites and
applications</p><p>In addition, I attended a Full Stack Web Development course, done before my internship to consolidate my knowledge in the
technologies that I would use. For my own interest I did a React.js course that allowed me to acquire some knowledge in a
technology that nowadays is so widely used. These courses were done on Udemy.</p><p>I am enthusiastic about learning new technologies, what I may lack in experience I do not lack in will to learn and progress in
my career.</p></div>
